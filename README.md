# My solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges

All solutions are written in TypeScript since I am currently learning it.
Every solution has 2 functions in it that solve the 2 parts of the challenge. Some of the code is re-used in the second part, since each part represents a standalone solution.

## Running the scripts
You need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) to run the scripts.

Inside the challenge directory:
* Install the possible dependencies with `npm install` 
* Run the script with `npm start`

**Note**: The solutions may not be optimized at all! I am doing this mostly for *fun*.
